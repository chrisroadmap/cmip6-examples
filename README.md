# cmip6-examples
Here are a few notebooks showcasing other people's tools that can download and manipulate CMIP6 data.

## Requirements

You need `python` 3.7+ and `conda`. These instructions should work for Windows when using Anaconda Prompt and for MacOS in Terminal (and by extension, likely will work on Linux).

First create a new environment from the `yaml` file with the necessary dependencies:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

When this is done, activate the environment:

```
conda activate cmip6-examples
```

Then, the notebooks themselves can be accessed and run from the `notebooks` directory.
